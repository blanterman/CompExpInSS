    "To use $\\mathtt{lsim()}$, the coefficients $a_k$ and $b_m$ must be stored in MATLAB vectors $\\mathtt{a}$ and $\\mathtt{b}$, respectively, in descending order of the indices $k$ and $m$, Rewriting Eq. (2.11) in terms of the vectors $\\mathtt{a}$ and $\\mathtt{b}$ gives\n",

    "Note that $\\mathtt{a}$ must contain N + 1 elements, which might require appending zeros to $\\mathtt{a}$ to account for coefficients $a_k$ that equal zero.

The vector $\\mathtt{t}$ contains the time samples for the input and output, $\\mathtt{x}$ contains the values of the input $x(t)$ at each time in $\\mathtt{t}$. The accuracy of the simulated values depends upon how well $\\mathtt{x}$ and $\\mathtt{t}$ represent the true function $x(t)$.\n",

    "While this tutorial does not describe the numerical methods used by $\\mathtt{lsim()}$ to compute $\\mathtt{y}$, it is important to know how $\\mathtt{lsim()}$ interprets the inputs $\\mathtt{x}$ and $\\mathtt{t}$. Basically, $\\mathtt{lsim()}$ interpolates the pair $\\mathtt{t}$,$\\mathtt{x}$ in much the same way as does $\\mathtt{plt.plot()}$. For instance, consider the plot produced by the following code:\n",

    "$\\mathtt{>>>t = [0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10]}$\n",
